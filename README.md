If you'd like to install docker from the official repos, please run this:

`curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serverir/dciu/main/docker.sh | bash`
If you'd like to install/update docker-compose from the github repo, please run this:

`curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serverir/dciu/main/docker-compose.sh | bash`
Running docker-compose.sh script not also installs docker-compose, but also if installs, updates/upgrades too.

This supposes your docker-compose file is located at /usr/bin/docker-compose.

`curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serverir/dciu/main/main.sh | bash`
If you're going to run both.
